As a child, I was overly fascinated by technology and how things worked "under the hood." In amazement, I would take things apart, marvel at its inner workings while challenging myself to put it back together again. Around the age of nine, I received an unexpected and much-welcomed gift. My very own personal computer! I'd like to think of this as the place in time where it all began. This moment was surely the most defining and pivotal in my young life. No longer would I have to wait for schooldays to use the equipment in the computer lab. Thanks to the attentiveness and observation of wonderful parents, I could finally explore the world of technology from my home and let my imagination soar to new heights. 

**Robots in My Room!**

I spent much of my summers locked away in my room, attempting to figure out all there was to know about this shiny new toy. I suppose its true what they say, "practice makes perfect," because I had progressed to a high level of theoretical and practical knowledge in such a short time. I'd gone from sheer curiosity to building and repairing PC's, installing and configuring operating systems, upgrading hardware and even dabbling in a bit of networking. With my newly found technical skills and vivid imagination, I even started working on the prototype for my very own robot! It would be a simple project, just the typical robot that could clean my room, do my homework, and go to school for me. Nothing too fancy. 

I was having so much fun creating these little bots that they began to take over my room. I had thought of everything except one of the most important aspects in creation... the robot's brain. I researched and discovered that this would be accomplished by way of programming, but quickly became overwhelmed by the many languages and the idea of it all. Perhaps, I thought I wasn't smart enough? Maybe I would have continued had I seen people who looked liked me in the tech world? Whatever the case, I began to lose passion, not only for my personal projects but for technology in general.

**...Fast Forward**

The years came and went and along with it, my childhood. As an adult, I have had my fair share of jobs but no particular sense of direction. From retail, to call centers, to office administration and IP troubleshooting for a well-known company, I was still longing for a true career. I'd daydream often. Not of unicorns or what I'd be eating for dinner that day. Instead, my dreams were far more practical. I dreamt of stability, being able to provide financially for myself and my family and developing valuable and tangible sought after skills that would afford me a competitive edge in a fast-moving world. 

As a result of health issues that would limit me from working, I now had tons of time to sit and think about what I really wanted in a career.  I learned that I wanted a career where I would have the option to work remotely so that I could attend to my family and our health. I wanted to be able to use both sides of my brain. I needed to use the side of myself that is logical, practical, and analytical. But also the side that is creative, visionary, and imaginative. I desired a career where I could work freely and independently but also collaboratively with teammates. I wanted to be a creator, to build things using my brain, things that I could see, and products that had the possibility to bring about positive social and technological change. Lastly, I preferred a career where I would be able to conduct heavy amounts of research and writing. Writing has always been a true passion. In order to have a sense of fulfillment, I knew I needed the freedom and opportunity to express myself in a written manner. Also, an opportunity for entrepreneurship in the future wouldn't hurt. This would turn out to be a very tall order to fill but certainly not impossible. 

**What Was I Thinking?**

While staring at the computer, pondering upon the bulleted list I'd created, I realized that the answer was right under my nose, or in this case, right before my eyes. The answer I sought was not only within my computer the entire time, but it was my actual computer!

 Yes! I said to myself. How could I not see what was always so obvious to myself and others? I started to think back to my childhood days. I thought about how passionate I was about technology, the way I'd be enthralled and immersed for hours while problem-solving, the fun I had designing and how much I loved all things "creation." And then, I remembered that those passions were either long gone or had dwindled away by self-doubt, fear of failure, and the overall pressures of life. 

But this time felt different, I couldn't stop thinking about the things that once held my interest and captivated me. Would I  be able to re-ignite old passions? Could I develop new passions? Am I ready to finally learn to "program the proverbial robot?" The answer to those questions was not yes. But rather, I can try!  

**To Develop or Not Develop?**

The idea of trying felt like a minimal investment. At this point, I would have far more to gain than to lose. I made a vow to myself that I would give software development a shot. This time, it would be my best shot.  And that I did. And that I am still doing. 

There are days when those shots are quick layups, some days they are the fanciest of slam dunks and 3 pointers, and at other times, I've missed more shots than I've landed. But that's okay, that's the nature of learning and growing.

Each day I get equally excited and frustrated about solving the next complex problem. This journey of rediscovering has been life-altering and one of the most challenging undertakings, thus far. As I reflect on why I decided to learn software development, I find it rather difficult to come up with an exhaustive list of answers.  The world of programming expands as high as the sky and climbing it is like climbing a never-ending mountain. There is no end in sight, yet you keep climbing.

So, why did I decide to learn software development? I guess... I didn't. I think software development decided to help me learn "me."
