One of the things I've wrestled with, academically, is recalling the things I've learned and moving beyond the "starting point." If you are a fellow programmer, you can most likely attest to the times when you've sat at your desk, staring at the blank page of your text editor, fingers lightly and subconsciously tapping away at the keyboard as you struggle to recall that method, syntax, or concept. This struggle to recall is pretty normal (and common) in an industry that is filled with constantly evolving tools and technologies. 

Learning a new skill, no matter the age can quickly become quite the challenge. As adult learners, we typically have more responsibilities, personal obligations, and hectic schedules that at times, make learning tedious and unsuccessful. And if that wasn't enough, for those of us who are learning technical topics, there is a greater challenge of comprehending complex theoretical and programmatic concepts, not to mention actually retaining the associated information. 

Application (applying concepts by performing them) is a huge part of programming. I've been studying software/web development for a little over a year now and I've discovered a very simple rule: "You can't apply what you haven't first learned." And how do we know if we have truly learned a given thing? For starters, we can measure our ability to recall the data that we've once reviewed.

It's easily tempting to experience false confidence after having passively reviewed material. In our process, we read for understanding, the little "light bulb" in our brain illuminates as we begin to understand, we then reach the point where we feel that we've confidently learned through our studies, and we move on to the next topic.

However, the problem with this process is that it's possible that we may not have actually retained the information. Sure, we may be able to remember in the present, while the book is open, while things are still fresh. But what about when the book is closed? What about an hour later? How about a day? Maybe even a month? Fortunately, there is a learning method called active recall, which helps the brain hold on to what we feed it. 

According to [Sam Di Sano at atomi](https://getatomi.com/staffroom/what-is-active-recall-and-how-effective-is-it/): "Active recall is the process of remembering information. It is an efficient way of moving information from short-term to long-term memory so that you can easily draw on it again when you need it most, such as for an assessment or exam." 

As programmers, implementing active recall can not only make us more efficient problem solvers but allow us to experience a greater ROI (return on investment) as we invest thousands of lifetime hours honing away at our craft. 

Want to give active recall a try? Great! It's actually pretty simple. The next time you study, attempt to look away from your notes. If you can recall the information, try explaining it to someone else to build self-confidence and ensure that you further solidify it within your brain. If you can't recall it, try reviewing it again. It's possible that more understanding is required. Take notes that highlight your trouble topics, review those troublesome areas, develop other points of reference as you study, and later, try recalling it again without your notes and references present. 

The [HowToStudy Blog](https://www.howtostudy.org/blog/?p=461) reminds us that: "Active learning is just as it sounds. In order to truly learn a new piece of information, you need to somehow trick your brain into working on it, activating new neural pathways and building new connections." 

Remember, when it comes to learning there are no shortcuts, only commitment, hard work and countless hours of practice. Building a better understanding often comes through time, repetition, and consistency. So, the next time you attempt to learn a new thing, give active recall a try. And by doing so, give your brain the ultimate reward... retainment!
