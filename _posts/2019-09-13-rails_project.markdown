**The Background**

Deciding on an idea for this project was not as difficult in comparison to past projects. I've always been fascinated by electronics and have amassed a nice collection of them throughout the years. From desktops to laptops, Bluetooth devices, and gaming consoles, I thought it would be a worthwhile endeavor to take inventory of the devices I own and share my thoughts and opinions of each device along with other collectors. 

As for technical specifications, this application emphasizes RESTful routing, CRUD operations, MVC architecture, and OmniAuth.

**The Process**

Coming up with an idea was only step one of the processes and proved to be the easiest aspect. I had to start and stop often and found myself researching a ton. I think I performed more Rails research than any other tool or framework I've learned thus far. 

I decided that I would have 3 models, a user, device, and comment model. I hoped that keeping the number of models to a minimum would make for less confusion. But looking back, I can see how a 4th model would be beneficial.

To save time, I used the resource generator. I would normally generate my models, views, and controllers separately but having everything generate all at once cut down on a lot of forgetfulness and indecisiveness while programming.

For my login system, I took a brief look at Devise but decided that my project was simple enough to build out the authentication, myself, similar to the Sinatra project. 

Once I got the basics of the application working I  focused my attention on OmniAtuth. In the OmniAuth lab, we used Facebook as a third-party login system. To extend my practice, I also used Facebook once more within my application.

As for styling, I wanted to keep it simple. I prefer minimalistic/clean designs but didn't want to leave it completely barebones. I thought this would be a good time to learn a little more about Bootstrap. I didn't get carried away with the Bootstrap styles but I discovered how awesome it can be for a quick navbar and displaying pre-styled error messages in the views.

**Final Thoughts**

Rails is an excellent user-friendly framework and a nice compliment to Ruby.  It's designed in such a way that someone with very little experiences (like myself) could get a site up and running in no time thanks to its "convention over configuration" paradigm. I look forward to becoming way more comfortable with Rails through refactoring and expanding the features and functionalities of my application.
